# SOLID Principles

Five principles for better OOP design:

1. **Single Responsibility**: One reason to change
2. **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable
4. **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions
